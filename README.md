I do not own SauceDemo. Website is owned by Sauce Labs. I am only using the website to practice and apply my knowledge on automation tools/frameworks.

### Tests

- Test 2: should display an error message in checkout if there are no items

Test Set: Authentication
- Test 1: should successfully login
- Test 2: should display an error message due to invalid credentials
- Test 3: should display an error message due to no credentials entered
- Test 4: should be able to successfully login and logout
